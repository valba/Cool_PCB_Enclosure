# Cool_PCB_Enclosure
This is a simple fan cooled box, reusing ideas and code from the following excellent projects:
  + "The Ultimate box maker" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1264391)
  + "Customizable Fan Grille" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52305).
  + "Radiator difussers" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6407)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
  + The coordinate system is mostly center based in order to simplify the integration between diffe     rent projects involved.
  + Fan grille's logos cannot be used through the Customizer App. In order to use Fan grille's logo     s, you must download both source code files and use Openscad instead.

Please, refer to original projects for additional documentation and samples.
